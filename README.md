# Minecraft-Pi

This is a weekend project for Minecraft Pi edition for Raspberry Pi.  
I made it for fun and hopefully people can build their own versions of it.  Please tell me if you find any issues and if you have any advice.

The process of building a part of the world that is flat takes a relatively long time so if anyone knows of any ways to optimize that process please tell me.

Happy Coding :)
